- **Data Definition Language**: A relational model was implemented in SQL with three tables: customers, products, and orders. Each table was defined with columns featuring appropriate data types and constraints, including PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and NOT NULL constraints.
  
- **Data Manipulation Language**: SQL DML queries were practiced by inserting records into the products, customers, and orders tables. The process involved updating an order quantity, deleting a customer, clearing the orders table, and dropping it, demonstrating proficiency in managing and modifying database records.
  
- **Data Query Language**: A relational model was implemented using SQL DDL, with data inserted via DML. Queries were written to analyze customer orders by product type, calculate costs, determine order quantities, and identify top customers and products, including those who ordered on every day of the week.
  
- **Relational Model**: The entity-relationship diagram was converted into a relational model, which was then implemented and populated with SQL data. Queries were executed to list and sort producers, filter by region, calculate wine quantities, and identify specific wines based on degree and producer number.

- **Relational Model Identification**: Distinguished between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships in a relational database.
